    * Build system now uses the Autotools.

    * Renamed main program from tagger to sndchk and converted it to
      C.  Renamed tags to sndtags.

    * Cleaned up pre-GitHub history since 2014.


2018-12-18  sndchk v0.0.0  <johan@hattne.se>

    * Initial version.  Runs on one particular little-endian MacBook
      Pro with ALAC audio files and iTunes metadata but probably nothing
      else.
