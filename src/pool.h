/**
 * @file pool.h
 * @brief Simple scheduler for fingersum jobs
 *
 * The pool module implements a scheduler for fingersum jobs
 * (i.e. AccurateRip checksum and Chromaprint fingerprint
 * calculations).  It maintains a single, global pool of worker
 * threads.
 *
 * Uses a thread pool to do fingersum in parallel.  Jobs are processed
 * in the order they are submitted.
 *
 * Should be equivalent to plain fingersum with nmemb == 1.  The case
 * nmemb == 0 should work as well.
 *
 * Processing starts in the order jobs are submitted.  Due to the
 * multiprocessing nature, they may not finish in that order, though.
 *
 * XXX Maybe better named fspool?  Nah...
 *
 * Implements "first come, first served" (FCFS) scheduling.
 *
 * XXX Would be nicer if we could accept a callback and user data
 * instead of the ACTIONS enumeration.
 *
 * XXX Review https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization)
 *
 * XXX Could have an option to start a new thread whenever no free
 * threads are available, but that probably also requires the ability
 * to reap idle threads.  And then the whole bit about dynamic
 * resizing of a pool becomes an issue.
 *
 * All jobs/tasks have the same priority
 *
 * @note While the module is thread-safe, any particular RESULTS
 *       context may only be operated on by a single thread at a time.
 *       The pool context does not have this limitation.
